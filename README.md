# ðŸŒ¶Introducing the SpiceMate

A contactless spice dispenser device utilising a Flight of Time proximity sensor VL6180X, an ERM vibrational motor driven by a DRV2605/L driver and a SG90 Micro Servo als operated through a Raspberry Pi 3B.
During operation dispensing is triggered when an object is introduced to the region monitored by the sensor. Motor activation/deactivation occurs in response to retained presence of the object within the sensor field.
