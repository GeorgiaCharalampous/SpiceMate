# ðŸŒ¶Introducing the SpiceMate

A contactless spice dispenser device utilising a Time of Flight proximity sensor VL6180X, an ERM vibrational motor driven by a DRV2605L driver and a SG90 Micro Servo all operated using a Raspberry Pi 3B.
During operation dispensing is triggered when an object is introduced to the region monitored by the sensor. Motor activation/deactivation occurs in response to retained presence of the object within the sensor field.

- ### Increase efficiency & hygiene through contactless control

- ### Greater accessibility & independance in the kitchen for people with limited dexterity

- ### Spice wastage minimisation through real-time response to events

- ### Actuate response to stimulus with a maximum **end-to-end latency** of under **500um**
